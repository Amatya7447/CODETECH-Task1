overview of project

project:Java Programming

Objective
simple calculator project is a great foundational step in programming. It demonstrates an understanding of core concepts such as input handling, conditional statements, and possibly function or object-oriented programming, depending on your implementation. A well-done calculator project emphasizes clarity, error handling, and user-friendly design.


Design and Planning:

Outlined the functionalities of the calculator (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Defined the structure and flow of the program.

Implementation:
Coded the calculator using a programming language like Python, Java, or C++.
Ensured clean and modular code, possibly implementing reusable functions or classes.

Error Handling:
Incorporated checks to handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values) or divide-by-zero errors.

Testing:
Performed tests on various edge cases to ensure the calculator works accurately in all scenarios.
User Interface Design:
Created an intuitive interface, whether through a command-line interface or graphical user interface (GUI).

Documentation:
Documented the code, explaining the purpose and functionality of different sections.
